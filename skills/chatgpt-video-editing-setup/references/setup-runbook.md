# Setup runbook

Use this runbook only after the setup Skill has inspected the machine and the
user has approved the listed mutations. Re-read the upstream documentation at
execution time because install instructions can change.

## 1. Inspect and propose

Use exact official HTTPS origins. Do not accept a fork, a similarly named
repository, a missing `origin`, or another transport form, and never rewrite a
remote automatically:

- video-use: `https://github.com/browser-use/video-use.git`
- HyperFrames: `https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes.git`

Check the required video-use location before acting. Check HyperFrames only if
the user explicitly requested or approved it. Do not inspect only for a `.git`
directory: in a linked worktree, `.git` is a file. The following preflight
recognizes both normal checkouts and linked worktrees, and rejects any existing
path that is not the expected clean repository:

```sh
inspect_repo() {
  repo=$1
  expected_origin=$2

  if [ ! -e "$repo" ] && [ ! -L "$repo" ]; then
    printf '%s\n' "missing repository: $repo"
    return 2
  fi

  inside=$(git -C "$repo" rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null) || {
    printf '%s\n' "STOP: existing path is not a Git worktree: $repo" >&2
    return 1
  }
  [ "$inside" = true ] || {
    printf '%s\n' "STOP: existing path is not inside a Git worktree: $repo" >&2
    return 1
  }

  commit=$(git -C "$repo" rev-parse --verify HEAD) || return 1
  branch=$(git -C "$repo" branch --show-current) || return 1
  [ -n "$branch" ] || branch="(detached at $commit)"
  actual_origin=$(git -C "$repo" remote get-url origin) || {
    printf '%s\n' "STOP: origin is missing: $repo" >&2
    return 1
  }
  [ "$actual_origin" = "$expected_origin" ] || {
    printf '%s\n' "STOP: unexpected origin for $repo: $actual_origin" >&2
    return 1
  }
  status=$(git -C "$repo" status --short) || return 1
  printf '%s\n' "repo=$repo" "origin=$actual_origin" \
    "branch=$branch" "commit=$commit" "status=${status:-clean}"
  [ -z "$status" ] || {
    printf '%s\n' "STOP: repository is dirty: $repo" >&2
    return 1
  }
}

video_use_origin=https://github.com/browser-use/video-use.git
inspect_repo "$HOME/Developer/video-use" "$video_use_origin" || {
  result=$?
  [ "$result" -eq 2 ] || exit 1
}
command -v git uv ffmpeg ffprobe python3
```

The `2` result means the expected path is absent and may be proposed for an
approved clone. Every other failure is a hard stop. In particular, an existing
non-repository path, missing or mismatched origin, invalid commit, or non-empty
status must stop the workflow before pull, reset, reclone, dependency install,
or Skill registration. Report the evidence and ask the user to resolve it or
choose a separate safe action. A clean fork is still the wrong repository.

When HyperFrames is requested, also require a real Node.js major-version check
before proposing any HyperFrames mutation:

```sh
command -v node npm npx bun
node_major=$(node -p 'process.versions.node.split(".")[0]') || exit 1
case "$node_major" in *[!0-9]*|'') exit 1 ;; esac
[ "$node_major" -ge 22 ] || {
  printf '%s\n' "STOP: HyperFrames requires Node.js 22 or newer; found major $node_major" >&2
  exit 1
}

hyperframes_origin=https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes.git
inspect_repo "$HOME/Developer/hyperframes" "$hyperframes_origin" || {
  result=$?
  [ "$result" -eq 2 ] || exit 1
}
```

If Node is older than 22, stop and propose an isolated version-manager setup as
a separate approval item. Do not replace or change the system Node.js without
approval. If HyperFrames was not requested, do not run its Node or repository
checks; report `HyperFrames 未要求`.

Before mutation, show an approval checklist tailored to what is missing:

- clone or update the source repositories;
- install Python, Node, FFmpeg, or package dependencies;
- download a large dependency or full media baseline;
- create/change a symlink or register an agent Skill;
- create or tighten the credential file.

Wait for a clear approval that covers the proposed changes. Do not treat a
request to “set it up” as approval after discovery reveals extra changes. Git
state can drift while approval is pending, so rerun the applicable `inspect_repo`
preflight immediately before every dependency installation and Skill
registration. Stop if origin, branch/commit validity, or cleanliness changed.

## 2. Install or repair video-use

The official source is `https://github.com/browser-use/video-use.git`. Keep the
whole repository at `~/Developer/video-use`; registering only a copied
`SKILL.md` is insufficient because its helpers are part of the workflow.

For a missing, approved checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/video-use.git "$HOME/Developer/video-use"
inspect_repo "$HOME/Developer/video-use" "https://github.com/browser-use/video-use.git"
cd "$HOME/Developer/video-use"
uv sync
```

Use the repository's current `install.md` and lockfile/package metadata at the
checked-out revision. If it directs a different supported installer, explain
that change and get approval before using it. Install FFmpeg only if `ffmpeg`
and `ffprobe` are absent; it is required by the workflow. Optional online-source
tools are separate and need their own approval.

Register the **entire** repository with the active agent's Skills directory.
After approval, rerun `inspect_repo` and preflight the exact destination before
creating any link. For the Codex location, use the following pattern:

```sh
target="$HOME/Developer/video-use"
destination="$HOME/.codex/skills/video-use"
test -d "$(dirname "$destination")" || exit 1
if [ -L "$destination" ]; then
  readlink "$destination"
  test "$(readlink "$destination")" = "$target" || exit 1
elif [ -e "$destination" ]; then
  exit 1
else
  ln -s "$target" "$destination"
fi
```

Report the `readlink` result for an existing symlink. Accept it only when it is
the exact intended target; otherwise stop. If any real file or directory exists
at the destination, stop. Create only a plain symlink at a confirmed absent
destination after approval—never replace, nest, or retarget an existing link.
Adapt the target to the current agent only after showing the exact link change.

## 3. Install optional HyperFrames source and Skills

Only offer this when the user needs HTML/CSS/GSAP animation or asks for it.
Use `https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes.git` at
`~/Developer/hyperframes`. Default to a source-only checkout so LFS media
baselines are not downloaded:

```sh
node_major=$(node -p 'process.versions.node.split(".")[0]') || exit 1
case "$node_major" in *[!0-9]*|'') exit 1 ;; esac
[ "$node_major" -ge 22 ] || exit 1
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes.git "$HOME/Developer/hyperframes"
inspect_repo "$HOME/Developer/hyperframes" "https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes.git"
cd "$HOME/Developer/hyperframes"
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

Honor the checkout's current lockfile and documented package manager. The
current upstream source uses `bun.lock`; if that changes, stop and follow the
then-current project documentation after approval. A full LFS baseline or any
large download requires separate explicit approval.

In an attended interactive terminal, open the full-depth picker:

```sh
npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --full-depth
```

The picker opens with nothing selected. Explicitly tell the user to select the
**Core Skills** group; that is the recommended set. Do not run this picker from
an agent or other non-interactive environment because an unscoped
non-interactive install can select all 19 Skills.

For an agent or other non-interactive environment, install exactly the core set
with the upstream CLI:

```sh
npx hyperframes skills update
```

Rerun `inspect_repo` immediately before either Skills command. The Node.js 22+
check also applies before `bun install`, `npx`, or any HyperFrames Skill
registration.

Only after the user explicitly approves installing all 19 Skills may you run:

```sh
npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --all --full-depth
```

For any local `npx` verification on this machine, isolate npm's cache rather
than changing cache ownership:

```sh
npm_config_cache=/private/tmp/hyperframes-npx-cache npx --yes hyperframes --help
```

## 4. Local, no-cost verification

After approved changes, verify the required video-use state locally:

```sh
inspect_repo "$HOME/Developer/video-use" "https://github.com/browser-use/video-use.git"
test -d "$HOME/Developer/video-use/helpers"
command -v ffmpeg ffprobe
```

Run the optional checks only when HyperFrames was explicitly approved **and**
installed in this setup:

```sh
if [ "$hyperframes_approved" = yes ] && [ "$hyperframes_installed" = yes ]; then
  inspect_repo "$HOME/Developer/hyperframes" "https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes.git"
  node_major=$(node -p 'process.versions.node.split(".")[0]') || exit 1
  case "$node_major" in *[!0-9]*|'') exit 1 ;; esac
  [ "$node_major" -ge 22 ] || exit 1
  test -f "$HOME/Developer/hyperframes/bun.lock"
  npx skills list
else
  printf '%s\n' 'HyperFrames 未要求；未執行 Repo、Node、bun.lock 或 Core Skills 檢查。'
fi
```

Set the two gate values from this setup session's explicit approval record and
observed install result; do not infer them merely because a path exists. A
skipped optional check is “not requested,” not a setup failure. Compare the
active agent's listed Skills with the exact Core Skills outcome recorded by the
approved `npx hyperframes skills update`; do not rerun an installer merely to
verify it.

Then use the checks in [security and verification](security-and-verification.md).
Do not pass media to any API, invoke transcription, create `edit/`, render, or
claim readiness based only on planned commands.

## 5. Optional Epidemic Sound MCP connection

Only run this branch when the user requests licensed background music or asks
to configure Epidemic Sound. Re-read the official documentation at
`https://developers.epidemicsound.com/docs/mcp/` because the MCP service is
beta and its tools or authentication may change.

The documented remote endpoint is
`https://www.epidemicsound.com/a/mcp-service/mcp`. Prefer a supported OAuth
flow in the active AI client. API-key authentication uses
`EPIDEMIC_SOUND_API_KEY`; keys must remain in secure connector settings or the
process environment and must never enter Git, a Skill, a media directory,
command arguments, chat, or logs.

After the user completes the client-side authorization, verify that the active
client exposes the required live tools. For automatic background music, the
minimum capability is music search plus track download. Duration adaptation,
stems, or sound effects require their corresponding tools. Do not call those
tools during setup; report their availability only. A subscription, account
page, or saved key is not sufficient evidence of a working connection.
